## Ask Alan!

Ask Alan is a dating advice app. If in doubt, Ask Alan!

Are you on a date that isn't going well? No problem! Alan will get the conversation flowing. Alan can recommend topics of conversation, provide you with hilarious jokes, and suggest some fantastic pickup lines.

This application was built by Team Alan at HAC100's Hack Manchester in 2018. Our challenge was to come up with the most bizarre use case of ClockworkSMS. See [here](https://www.clockworksms.com/blog/hack-manchester-2018/ "Read about the challenge on the ClockworkSMS website") for more details.

# My Contributions

AskAlan draws from a collection of predetermined responses, we had planned to store these in a database which would be made accesssible via an API. I created some routes in Express and connected them to a MongoDB database using Mongoose. 

Unfortunately we ran out of time when it came to connecting our work together at the end of the hackathon, Alan simply draws his responses from a dummy JSON file for now, maybe we'll connect him up to the database at some point in the future. :)
