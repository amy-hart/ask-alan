## Ask Alan!

Ask Alan is a dating advice and help tool. If in doubt, Ask Alan!

On a date? Not going well? No problem! Alan will get the conversation flowing. Alan can recommend topics of conversation, provide you with hilarious jokes, and suggest some fantastic pickup lines.

This application was built by Team Alan at HAC100's Hack Manchester in 2018. Our challenge was to come up with a bizzare usecase for ClockworkSMS. See [here](https://www.clockworksms.com/blog/hack-manchester-2018/ "Read about the challenge on the ClockworkSMS website") for more details.
