## Ask Alan!

Ask Alan is a dating advice app. If in doubt, Ask Alan!

Are you on a date that isn't going well? No problem! Alan will get the conversation flowing. Alan can recommend topics of conversation, provide you with hilarious jokes, and suggest some fantastic pickup lines.

This application was built by Team Alan at HAC100's Hack Manchester in 2018. Our challenge was to come up with the most bizarre use case of ClockworkSMS. See [here](https://www.clockworksms.com/blog/hack-manchester-2018/ "Read about the challenge on the ClockworkSMS website") for more details.

# Acknowledgements

I joined Team Alan and attended Hack Manchester with little development experience. My contributions to the app were limited due to my inexperience, but I really enjoyed the experience, and even managed to learn some new skills. 

AskAlan draws from a collection of predetermined responses. We had planned to store these responses in a database, which could be accessed via an API. I created some routes using Express, and used Mongoose to connect to a MongoDB database. Unfortunately we ran out of time when it came to combining our work towards the end of the Hackathon, so Alan draws responses from a JSON file for now, but may be connected to a database in the future.
